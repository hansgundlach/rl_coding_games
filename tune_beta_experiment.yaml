# Beta tuning experiment - copy from your main config and just change beta
# Run multiple short experiments with different beta values

# Experiment 1: Conservative (high stability)
beta_conservative: 0.15

# Experiment 2: Your current setting
beta_current: 0.1

# Experiment 3: More aggressive
beta_aggressive: 0.06

# Experiment 4: DeepSeek-style
beta_deepseek: 0.04

# Run each for 20-30 steps and compare:
# - training/rewards progression
# - policy/approx_kl values  
# - training stability (loss spikes, etc.)
